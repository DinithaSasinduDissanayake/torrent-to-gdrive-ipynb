# Agent Guidelines (Concise)

- Project: Colab-focused `.ipynb` notebooks and a py file that can be ran on google colab after uploading to colab and using !python filename.py
- do not create additional files . My main goal is to have a single py or ipynb file that
    1. can be ran on google colab
    2. can download torrent files 
    3. have a intutive gui for user interaction
    4. have as mininimum lines of code as possible
    5. has no comments 
- I am almost always asking you to improve an existing file not create something from scratch . 
- Instructions on libraries you can use :
    1. You have the freedom to use any popular python libraries available on google colab. 
    2. Do not use old , not maintained or obscure libraries. Random libraries you might find on github that does not even have 50 stars
    3. Use libraries that has proper well maintained documentation
    4. Usage of libraries that align with above instructions is encouraged . I want to have minimum lines of code as possible so if a library can help achieve that please use it    

- GUI Guidelines :
    1. GUI should be intuitive and easy to use
    2. GUI should have components for all the stuff implemented in the code . There cant be features that are implemented in the code but not accessible from the GUI . (obviously there can be features in the codebase that are not exposed to GUI those features are fine )

- Commit locally as frequently as possible .
