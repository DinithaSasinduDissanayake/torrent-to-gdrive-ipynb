# Torrent to GDrive (notebook)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation that downloads torrents and uploads their contents to Google Drive.

Contents:
- `notebook.ipynb` — main implementation (move your .ipynb here)

Usage:
1. Place your Jupyter notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) in the repo.
2. Follow the notebook cells to configure Google Drive API credentials and run the torrent-to-GDrive flow.

Notes:
